About the Blog

This blog isn’t just a collection of posts — it’s a timeline of my growth in computer science, AI, and beyond.
I write about:
What I’m learning in school and self-study
AI experiments, coding projects, and data explorations
Reflections on challenges, ideas, and progress
It’s part technical, part personal, and always evolving.
