About the Blog

This blog isnâ€™t just a collection of posts â€” itâ€™s a timeline of my growth in computer science, AI, and beyond.
I write about:
What Iâ€™m learning in school and self-study
AI experiments, coding projects, and data explorations
Reflections on challenges, ideas, and progress
Itâ€™s part technical, part personal, and always evolving.
